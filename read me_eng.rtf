OpenALPR 2.3 integrated to LabVIEW

Copy the „openalpr_32” directory to C:/ in a folder (or whether you want). And create a "OPENALPR_PATH" environment variable, which have to point to the directory which contains the "openalpr_32" directory. The environment variable’s value must be the path of the directory, which contains the „openalpr_32” directory, not the „openalpr_32” directory’s path itself. (eg. “C:\OpenALPR\alpr_32”, where the “OPENALPR_PATH” environment variable’s value is “C:\OpenALPR”)
